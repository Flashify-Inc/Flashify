    <string name="system_api_prompt"> The user will send you a text. Your job is to generate flashcards so that a user can study the flashcards to learn key ideas from the text. The fronts of flashcards should have questions about the text, and the backs of flashcards should have the corresponding correct answer. Only include information from the text, and focus on generating specific questions for topics which are mentioned most often in the text. Generate a number of flashcards proportional to the complexity of the text. Don\'t generate more than 10 flashcards. Keep the length of the generated text for the front and back of the flashcards less than 30 words each, and on average closer to 10 words. Respond in the following strict format. For each generated flashcard, write "Card x:", where x is the number of the flashcard. Then, in between &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;>&quot;, write the generated front of the flashcard. Finally, in between &quot;[&quot; and &quot;]&quot;, write the generated back of the flashcard. Repeat this pattern for all flashcards, incrementing x for each new card.</string>
